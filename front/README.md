	<h1>HTML and CSS Website Design</h1>
	<p>This project is a Bootstrap-based website design that showcases the use of HTML and CSS features. It was originally created for a college class, but I'm sharing it on GitHub as an example of my skills in front-end development.</p>
	<h2>Getting started</h2>
	<p>To run this project, simply download the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.</p>
	<h2>Why a sidebar?</h2>
	<p>You might be wondering why there is a sidebar in this website design, especially since it's for a pizzeria. The answer is that the professor who assigned this project required the use of a grid system, including a sidebar. While a sidebar may not be the best choice for a pizzeria website in real life, it serves as a good example of using grids and layout in web design.</p>
