# Docker Pizza App

Welcome to Docker Pizza App, a full-stack web application that allows you to order pizzas online. It is built using Docker containers to hold both front-end (Apache), server-side (Node.js), and database (MySQL) components.

## How to Run the App

Follow the steps below to run the Docker Pizza App:

1. Ensure that you have Docker installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Make sure that the ports 9001 (server), 8080 (front-end), and 3307 (database) are available on your host machine.
5. Run the command `docker compose up` to start the application.
6. Once the application has started, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

Please note that the initial start-up time may vary depending on various factors, and it may take up to three minutes on the first start due to the build process.
